Jojo Babie (28) postala je senzacija na društvenim mrežama. Lijepa manekenka broji više od šest milijuna pratitelja na Instagramu kojima svakodnevno 'servira' vruće fotografije. It's very easy to be misjudged on Social Media! For people who say I don't have feelings, I DO! 💯 im human and have everyday struggles just like everyone else.. - I know what it feels like to be alone. I know what it feels like when EVERYONE is against you. I know what It feels like when the people who you thought were "FRIENDS" weren't there during tough times 💔 I've gone through that and it was hurtful 😔...but it honestly was THE BEST thing that ever happened to me because I found myself and who I truly am 🙏🏻. I became INDEPENDENT and learned to be STRONG because all I had was MYSELF 🙌🏻. After awhile you become numb to any negative comment that gets thrown at you ...so being called a "STUPID WHORE", or "ALL YOU HAVE IS TITS AND ASS" will never effect me. I KNOW WHO I AM ❤and i don't think I'm better than anyone! It makes me happy to see other people happy and I believe everyone deserves to be given a chance. NEVER JUDGE SOMEONE WITHOUT GETTING TO KNOW THEM! 🙌🏻 A post shared by J O J O ✨ B A B i E (@jojo_babie) on May 11, 2017 at 5:11pm PDT Bujna plavuša objavila je 'fotku' u kupaćem kostimu u kojem je jedva 'ukrotila' svoje obline.

"THERE IS NO ROOM FOR NEGATIVITY IN THE SUCCESS EQUATION"- CEO @Andyfrisella 💯 - ☝🏻This spoke to me today and the truth is we are all surrounded by negativity..but ONLY YOU allow what is in your life and what you block out! 💡Of course it's hard to stay positive, if I told you I was positive everyday.. I'd be lying! But you have to TRUST YOURSELF 💯 SET a goal that you want in your life and eliminate the things that stop you from getting there! ☝🏻 Surround yourself with positive thoughts 💭 and positive people! ❤@1stPhorm everyone is ACCEPTED! doesn't matter what shape and size you are! We are all going the same direction in improving ourselves 🏃🏼‍♀️💪🏼 We are born to SHINE, be the BEST version of ourselves, and MOTIVATE others! 👊🏻 #1stPhorm A post shared by J O J O ✨ B A B i E (@jojo_babie) on May 9, 2017 at 5:30pm PDT Nedavno se pohvalila 'fotkom' na kojoj je istaknula svoju bujnu stražnjicu.
